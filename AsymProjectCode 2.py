## Introduction

    st.markdown("""
## What is Asymmetric Information?
In a market seeking to maximize total surplus, both buyers and sellers have perfect information about the quality of the product on the market. For example, the grocery store sells many products at a price that matches the supply and demand market in which everyone is aware about the quality. I know the quality of the cereal when I purchase it and so does the seller, which is why the prices for different types of cereal can vary so much. In the instance of asymmetric information, only the seller knows the true quality of the product being sold. The following simulation highlights the loss of economic activity due to the lack of perfect information as well as some policies that shift the effects of asymmetric information.

## How the Simulation Works
Using a randomized distribution forming a normal approximation (bell curve) around a given quality mark, we can simulate rounds where:  
- Buyers pay in their best interest  
- Sellers act in their best interest (staying or leaving the market)  
- Policies are introduced to see how they can impact the market  

The results of each round are shown in the next round and the metrics are shown along with it. Policy parameters and the option of signaling explained below can be implemented. Additionally, the average quality, the number of sellers, the standard deviation of the quality marks, and the number of rounds being simulated can all be customized to simulate different distinct market situations.

### Simulation Parameters
- **Starting Average Quality**: The average quality of the initial randomization of the quality of sellers (normal randomization will result in bell curve centered on this value)  
- **Quality Standard Deviation**: The standard deviation of the initial randomization of the quality of sellers from the average quality  
- **Number of Sellers**: The number of sellers along with their quality being randomized 
- **Number of Rounds**: The number of rounds to simulate in the market (each round will show the results of the previous round)

--- 

### Policy Parameters
- **Minimum Quality Standard**: The lowest acceptable quality allowed to enter the market (removes all sellers holding qualities below this value)  
- **Subsidy**: A government extra payment to sellers with a quality above the high quality threshold  
- **Penalty**: A government tax to the sellers with a quality below the low quality threshold  
- **Signaling**: Enables sellers with a quality above the high quality threshold to pay a cost to signal their high quality level to buyers who in turn pay a bonus to these sellers  
- **Signaling Cost**: Cost of acquiring the signal (think price of a college degree)  
- **Signaling Bonus**: Bonus allotted to sellers as a result of the signal (must be higher than cost to incentivize)  
- **High Quality Threshold**: Value marking any quality equal to or below as ‘high quality’  
- **Low Quality Threshold**: Value marking any quality equal to or below as ‘low quality’ 
                                                     
---
                                                     
### Insight Metrics
- **Expected Quality**: Average quality of sellers currently in the market  
- **Market Price**: Example scaled price that buyers are set to pay for a quality (in this simulation: mp = expected quality * 1000)  
- **Seller’s Valuation**: A sellers’ own valuation of their product (individual quality * 1000 without policies or signaling)  
- **Expected Payout**: The payout that the seller perceives as receiving in staying in the market (will leave if seller valuation is less than expected payout)  
- **Sells**: Whether or not the seller would stay in the market (True if seller valuation is less than or equal to expected payout)  
- **Seller Surplus**: The difference between the sellers’ valuation and the expected payout if the payout is greater than or equal to the valuation  
- **Buyer Surplus**: The difference between the sellers’ valuation and the market price  
- **Government Cost**: The cost the government incurs from penalties or subsidies  
- **Total Social Surplus**: The sum of the buyer and seller surplus minus the government cost with penalties or subsidies  
- **Penalty Amount**: The tax on the payout to sellers below the low quality threshold  
- **Subsidy Amount**: The addition to the payout to sellers above the high quality threshold  
- **High Quality**: True if individual quality is greater than or equal to high quality threshold  
- **Low Quality**: True if individual quality is less than or equal to low quality threshold  
- **Net Signaling**: Addition to the payout as a result of signaling (signaling bonus - signaling cost)

### Simulation Parameters
- **Starting Average Quality**: The average quality of the initial randomization of the quality of sellers (normal randomization will result in bell curve centered on this value)  
- **Quality Standard Deviation**: The standard deviation of the initial randomization of the quality of sellers from the average quality  
- **Number of Sellers**: The number of sellers along with their quality being randomized 
- **Number of Rounds**: The number of rounds to simulate in the market (each round will show the results of the previous round)

--- 

### Policy Parameters
- **Minimum Quality Standard**: The lowest acceptable quality allowed to enter the market (removes all sellers holding qualities below this value)  
- **Subsidy**: A government extra payment to sellers with a quality above the high quality threshold  
- **Penalty**: A government tax to the sellers with a quality below the low quality threshold  
- **Signaling**: Enables sellers with a quality above the high quality threshold to pay a cost to signal their high quality level to buyers who in turn pay a bonus to these sellers  
- **Signaling Cost**: Cost of acquiring the signal (think price of a college degree)  
- **Signaling Bonus**: Bonus allotted to sellers as a result of the signal (must be higher than cost to incentivize)  
- **High Quality Threshold**: Value marking any quality equal to or below as ‘high quality’  
- **Low Quality Threshold**: Value marking any quality equal to or below as ‘low quality’ 
                                                     
---
                                                     
### Insight Metrics
- **Expected Quality**: Average quality of sellers currently in the market  
- **Market Price**: Example scaled price that buyers are set to pay for a quality (in this simulation: mp = expected quality * 1000)  
- **Seller’s Valuation**: A sellers’ own valuation of their product (individual quality * 1000 without policies or signaling)  
- **Expected Payout**: The payout that the seller perceives as receiving in staying in the market (will leave if seller valuation is less than expected payout)  
- **Sells**: Whether or not the seller would stay in the market (True if seller valuation is less than or equal to expected payout)  
- **Seller Surplus**: The difference between the sellers’ valuation and the expected payout if the payout is greater than or equal to the valuation  
- **Buyer Surplus**: The difference between the sellers’ valuation and the market price  
- **Government Cost**: The cost the government incurs from penalties or subsidies  
- **Total Social Surplus**: The sum of the buyer and seller surplus minus the government cost with penalties or subsidies  
- **Penalty Amount**: The tax on the payout to sellers below the low quality threshold  
- **Subsidy Amount**: The addition to the payout to sellers above the high quality threshold  
- **High Quality**: True if individual quality is greater than or equal to high quality threshold  
- **Low Quality**: True if individual quality is less than or equal to low quality threshold  
- **Net Signaling**: Addition to the payout as a result of signaling (signaling bonus - signaling cost)

                - **Used Car Market**: Lemon laws that require sellers to disclose known defects.
